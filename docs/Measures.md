Fish&Feats offers several options to quantify tissue properties at the single cell level:

* [Classify cells](./Classify-cells.md):<span style="background-color:#bda30f"> classify cells into user-defined categories</span>
* [Measure cytoplasmic intensity](./Measure-cytoplasmic-staining.md):<span style="background-color:#bda30f"> Measure the intensity of selected staining(s) in each cell cytoplasm </span>
* [Measure nuclear intensity](./Measure-nuclear-staining.md):<span style="background-color:#bda30f"> Measure the intensity of selected staining(s) in each cell nucleus or all nuclei </span>
* [Measure RNA intensity](./Get-RNAs.md#measure-intensity):<span style="background-color:#0b8300"> Measure the intensity of selected staining(s) in each segmented RNA </span>
